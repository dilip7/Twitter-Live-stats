# demoapp

#based on entered keyword the app reports count of domains embedded in tweets. 

it fetched live stats for a keyword say "android" , shows domains and count of twweets .

However I have for now kept google.co.in or app.facebook.com as domain as going for two charachter domain was a big pain to do  and I spent lot of time but nothing worthwhile was achieved, for demo purpose I think this much would suffice

clicking on  domain shows list of tweets which had the specified domain url in them (either directly or shortened)
